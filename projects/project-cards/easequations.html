            <p>A project that I began in high school after a teacher said that if 
                we coded our own app, we could use it on the math final. Over time
                it evolved into a bit of a sandbox of where I played around with UI 
                via XAML, classes in C#, and other features that seemed fun to try.
                For a while, I have considered this my 'flagship' app.
