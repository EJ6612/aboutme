      <h2>
        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home Page</h3>
      <h4>Home Page Summary:</h4>
      <p>
        The user will be greeted with a navigation banner. The navigation banner will have my logo, and links to my subpages 
        (projects and contact). Underneath the navi-banner, there will be a current photo of me and a welcome card. As the user 
        scrolls down, there will be cards of various topics: cards that introduce the user to who I am as a person and my purposes, 
        cards that introduce the content of the projects subpage (in the which will direct the user to that specific part of the 
        subpage), and a card that invites the user to contact me (which will direct the user to the contact subpage). The end of the 
        page will end with a footer, which will have my copyright, link to site plan, and outside links (GitHub, TBD). 
      </p>

      <h4>Welcome Card</h4>
      <p>
        Technically 2 separate items. On one side (probably the left) will be a up-to-date picture of me. On the other side (probably 
        the right) will be a card with text. The text will more than likely say “[tbd]”.
      </p>

      <h4>Introduction Cards</h4>
      <p>
        Introduction cards will have headers that each state something about me, with paragraph text that elaborate on that. Each topic 
        will have an accompanying icon. Topics: 
      </p>

      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Header</th>
          <th>Elaboration</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Creative</td>
          <td>I strive to think outside the box to find imaginative and efficient outcomes.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Fun</td>
          <td>Uplifting those around me is one of my life goals. It is my personal belief 
            that an optimistic attitude is an essential key for success.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Personal</td>
          <td>[something about me being a personal person]</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Sociable</td>
          <td>Being distant is the opposite of who I am. I have found that being a good 
            caring friend (with boundaries!) is needed for a good group environment.</td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <h4>Project Cards</h4>
      <p>
        Project cards will introduce the user to the various projects that I have worked on. Each one will have a header, logo (if one 
        exists), screenshot (if one exists), a short blurb, and a link that leads the user to its place in the projects subpage. Projects: 
      </p>
      
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Header/Title</th>
          <th>Blurb</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>easEquations</td>
          <td>Windows math app that serves as my place to learn and apply coding and design principles.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>BYU-I Projects</td>
          <td>Projects worked on during my time at BYU-Idaho.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Sno-Isle Tech Projects</td>
          <td>Game projects worked on during my time at Sno-Isle Tech.</td>
        </tr>
      </table>      

      <h4>Contact Card</h4>
      <p>
        Contact card will be very simple. It will have a header stating “Contact Me!”. The card will itself be a button, which leads the 
        user to the contact subpage. 
      </p>

      <h4>Footer</h4>
      <p>
        The footer will span the entire bottom of the page. From left to right it will have: 
        <ul>
          <li>© 2023 - Elijah Dodge</li>
          <li>Site Plan Link</li>
          <li>GitHub logo link (maybe)</li>
          <li>Microsoft Store logo link (maybe)</li>
          <li>Site logo</li>
        </ul>        
      </p>

      <h4>Design Language</h4>
      <p>Navigation Banner: Sticky, slightly rounded corners, drop shadow, is an “island”, primary color.</p>
      <p>Footer: Sharp corners, simple, secondary color.</p>
      <p>Cards: Slightly rounded corners, drop shadow, color will vary. Photos in cards will have drop shadows.</p>

      <h4>Desktop vs. Mobile</h4>
      <p>Desktop:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Cards will be spread out (style TBD).</li>
        <li>Navigation banner and footer will stay as previously described.</li>
        <li>Max-width will be 1400px. 1600px is too wide and spacious for what I am trying to accomplish. Blank sides could potentially 
          have a hazed-out background.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Mobile:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Cards will be stacked (preferably on top of each other, but if not vertically will be fine).</li>
        <li>Navigation banner will be sticky and lose the island effect. Sharp corners. I will aim to have the subpage links scrollable, but 
          if not, I will fall back to the old hamburger menu design. Logo will not be part of the banner, but rather just placed at the top of 
          the page.</li>
        <li>Space will be given between cards to allow user space to scroll. </li>
      </ul>

      <p>Images for the Home page</p>
        <img width="300px" src="../images/backgrounds/snowflakes_1.JPG" alt="background image">
        <img width="100px" src="../images/face_icon.png" alt="site icon">

      </ul>
      <h3>Projects</h3>
      <p>
        Projects subpage will inherit most of the design language from the home page. 
        From top to bottom (this will apply for both desktop and mobile), there will be one card 
        for each project divided by category. Each card will have a logo, screenshot (if applicable), 
        description, and link (preferably in the form of an icon).
      </p>
      <p>Images for Projects Page</p>
      <img width="150px" src="../projects/images/eEq_bold_squircle.png" alt="easEquations logo">
      <img width="150px" src="../projects/images/ms-store-logo.jpeg" alt="microsoft store logo, copyright Microsoft">

      </ul>
      <h3>Contact Me</h3>
      <p>
        Contact subpage will inherit most of the design language from the home page.
        There will be a big card with my current face, email, and social media. 
      </p>
      <p>Images for Contact Page</p>
        <img width="200px" src="../contact/images/april-2023-elijah.jpg" alt="most current face">

        Create three wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them here</p>
